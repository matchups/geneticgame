# Genetic Game
> A framework for using the technique of genetic programming to optimize strategies for two-player games.
<hr>
This framework functions by taking a class which knows about the game and is able to manage a match between two strategy objects, and the framework handles the evolutionary and recordkeeping aspects and gives you, at the end, the hopefully winning strategy.

The framework supports a range of settings, such as the numbers of crossovers and mutations, and also has a collection of hooks for further customization, such as the mutation mechanism.
